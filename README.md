# Discord bot
A bot I programmed in three hours so I can have fun with my colleagues on discord. Written in python.
It does require python3.4 or superior. Are you still reading? I want it to be the swiss knife of bots. Have any idea? Tell me.

## How to install it on your server.
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/elblogbruno/discord-bot`
2. Access the folder `cd discord-bot`
3. Install the required requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open secrets.py file and fill in with all the tokens from the API's
5. Start the bot `python3 bot.py`
